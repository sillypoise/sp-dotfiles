# TigerStyle Rulebook — Zig / Strict / Compact

## Preamble

This is the compact Zig variant of the TigerStyle Strict rulebook. Each rule is an imperative with
a one-line rationale. For full rationale and Zig examples, see `tigerstyle-zig-strict-full.md`.

**Design goal priority:** Safety > Performance > Developer Experience.

**Keywords:** MUST, SHALL, MUST NOT — absolute requirements. Violations are defects.

**Zig baseline:** latest stable. `zig fmt` required. `zig build test` required. Runtime safety must
remain on except in audited hot paths with documented invariants.

Rule IDs are stable across all TigerStyle variants for cross-referencing.
Rules marked **(Zig)** have been adapted from the language-agnostic version.

## Safety & Correctness (SAF)

**SAF-01** — All control flow MUST be simple and explicit. Recursion MUST NOT be used.
Rationale: Ensures bounded, analyzable execution.

**SAF-02** — All loops, queues, retries, and buffers MUST have a fixed upper bound.
Rationale: Prevents infinite loops, tail-latency spikes, and resource exhaustion.

**SAF-03** **(Zig)** — Integer types MUST be explicitly sized (u32, i64). `usize` MUST NOT be used except for indexing/API needs.
Rationale: Eliminates architecture-specific behavior and overflow ambiguity.

**SAF-04** — Every function MUST assert its preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.
Rationale: Assertions catch programmer errors early; crashing is correct on corruption.

**SAF-05** — Assertion density MUST average at least 2 per function.
Rationale: High density is a force multiplier for correctness and fuzzing yield.

**SAF-06** — Every enforced property MUST have paired assertions on at least two different code paths.
Rationale: Bugs hide at the boundary between valid and invalid data.

**SAF-07** — Compound assertions MUST be split: `assert(a); assert(b);` not `assert(a and b)`.
Rationale: Split assertions isolate failure causes and improve readability.

**SAF-08** — Implications MUST be expressed as single-line asserts: `if (a) assert(b)`.
Rationale: Preserves logical intent without complex boolean expressions.

**SAF-09** **(Zig)** — Compile-time constants and type sizes MUST be asserted at compile time or startup.
Rationale: Catches design integrity violations before runtime.

**SAF-10** — Assertions MUST cover both positive space (expected) and negative space (not expected).
Rationale: Boundary-crossing bugs are the most common class of correctness errors.

**SAF-11** — Tests MUST exercise valid inputs, invalid inputs, and boundary transitions.
Rationale: 92% of catastrophic failures stem from incorrect handling of non-fatal errors.

**SAF-12** — All memory MUST be statically allocated at initialization. No runtime reallocation.
Rationale: Avoids unpredictable latency, fragmentation, and use-after-free.

**SAF-13** — Variables MUST be declared at the smallest possible scope; minimize variables in scope.
Rationale: Reduces misuse probability and limits blast radius of errors.

**SAF-14** — No function SHALL exceed 70 lines.
Rationale: Forces clean decomposition; eliminates scrolling discontinuity.

**SAF-15** — All branching logic (if/switch) MUST remain in parent functions, not helpers.
Rationale: Centralizes case analysis in one place.

**SAF-16** — State mutation MUST be centralized in parent functions. Leaf functions MUST be pure.
Rationale: Localizes bugs to one mutation site; enables testable helpers.

**SAF-17** **(Zig)** — `zig fmt` and `zig build test` MUST pass. Runtime safety MUST NOT be disabled except in audited hot paths.
Rationale: Warnings and disabled safety hide correctness issues.

**SAF-18** — External events MUST be queued and batch-processed, not handled inline.
Rationale: Keeps control flow bounded and internal.

**SAF-19** — Compound boolean conditions MUST be split into nested if/else branches.
Rationale: Makes case coverage explicit and verifiable.

**SAF-20** — Invariants MUST be stated positively. Negated conditions MUST NOT be used.
Rationale: Positive form aligns with natural reasoning about bounds and validity.

**SAF-21** — Every error MUST be handled explicitly. No error SHALL be silently ignored.
Rationale: Error-handling bugs are the dominant cause of catastrophic production failures.

**SAF-22** — Every non-obvious decision MUST have a comment or commit message explaining why.
Rationale: Rationale enables safe future changes; code without "why" is incomplete.

**SAF-23** — All options MUST be passed explicitly to library calls. Defaults MUST NOT be relied upon.
Rationale: Defaults can change across versions, introducing latent bugs.

## Performance & Design (PERF)

**PERF-01** — Performance MUST be considered during design, not deferred to profiling.
Rationale: Architecture-level wins (1000x) cannot be retrofitted.

**PERF-02** — Back-of-the-envelope calculations MUST be performed for network, disk, memory, and CPU.
Rationale: Rough math guides design into the right 90% of solution space.

**PERF-03** — Optimization MUST target the slowest resource first, weighted by access frequency.
Rationale: Bottleneck-focused optimization yields the largest gains.

**PERF-04** — Control plane (scheduling, metadata) MUST be separated from data plane (bulk processing).
Rationale: Enables batching without sacrificing assertion safety.

**PERF-05** — Network, disk, memory, and CPU costs MUST be amortized via batching.
Rationale: Per-item overhead dominates at high throughput.

**PERF-06** — Hot paths MUST have predictable, linear control flow.
Rationale: Predictability enables cache utilization and branch prediction.

**PERF-07** — Performance-critical code MUST be explicit. Compiler optimizations MUST NOT be assumed.
Rationale: Compiler heuristics are fragile and non-portable.

**PERF-08** — Hot loop functions MUST take primitive arguments. Avoid large receiver access.
Rationale: Enables register allocation without alias analysis overhead.

---

## Developer Experience & Naming (DX)

**DX-01** — Names MUST capture what a thing is or does with precision.
Rationale: Great names are the essence of great code.

**DX-02** **(Zig)** — Files/functions/variables: snake_case. Types: Zig conventions.
Rationale: Consistency with Zig style reduces friction.

**DX-03** — Names MUST NOT be abbreviated (except trivial loop counters i, j, k).
Rationale: Abbreviations are ambiguous; full names are unambiguous.

**DX-04** — Acronyms MUST use standard capitalization (HTTPClient, SQLQuery).
Rationale: Standard form is unambiguous.

**DX-05** — Units and qualifiers MUST be appended to names, sorted by descending significance.
Rationale: Groups related variables visually and semantically.

**DX-06** — Resource names MUST convey lifecycle and ownership.
Rationale: Cleanup expectations must be obvious from the name.

**DX-07** — Related variable names MUST be aligned by character length when feasible.
Rationale: Symmetry improves visual parsing and correctness checking.

**DX-08** — Helper/callback names MUST be prefixed with the calling function's name.
Rationale: Makes call hierarchy visible in the name.

**DX-09** — Callbacks MUST be the last parameter in function signatures.
Rationale: Mirrors control flow (callbacks are invoked last).

**DX-10** — Important declarations (public API) MUST appear first in a file.
Rationale: Files are read top-down; important context comes first.

**DX-11** — Struct layout MUST follow: fields → types → methods.
Rationale: Predictable layout enables navigation by position.

**DX-12** — Names MUST NOT be overloaded with multiple domain-specific meanings.
Rationale: Overloaded terms cause confusion across contexts.

**DX-13** — Externally-referenced names MUST be nouns that work as prose and section headers.
Rationale: Noun names compose cleanly in documentation and conversation.

**DX-14** — Functions with confusable arguments MUST use named option structs.
Rationale: Prevents silent transposition bugs at the call site.

**DX-15** — Nullable parameters MUST be named so null's meaning is clear at the call site.
Rationale: `foo(null)` is meaningless; `foo(timeout_ns: null)` is not.

**DX-16** — Singleton constructor params MUST be ordered from most general to most specific.
Rationale: Consistent ordering reduces cognitive load.

**DX-17** — Commit messages MUST be descriptive and explain the purpose of the change.
Rationale: Commit history is permanent documentation visible in `git blame`.

**DX-18** — Comments MUST explain "why," not "what."
Rationale: "Why" enables safe future changes; "what" restates the code.

**DX-19** — Tests and complex logic MUST include a description of goal and methodology.
Rationale: Tests are documentation; readers need context to understand or skip them.

**DX-20** — Comments MUST be well-formed sentences (space, capital, full stop).
Rationale: Sloppy comments signal sloppy thinking.

## Cache Invalidation & State Hygiene (CIS)

**CIS-01** — Every piece of state MUST have exactly one source of truth. No duplication or aliasing.
Rationale: Duplicated state will desynchronize.

**CIS-02** **(Zig)** — Function arguments larger than 16 bytes MUST be passed by `*const`.
Rationale: Avoids implicit copies and stack waste.

**CIS-03** **(Zig)** — Large structs MUST be initialized in-place via out pointers.
Rationale: Avoids copies and ensures pointer stability.

**CIS-04** **(Zig)** — If any field requires in-place init, the entire struct MUST be initialized in-place.
Rationale: In-place init is viral; mixing strategies breaks pointer stability.

**CIS-05** — Variables MUST be declared and computed as close as possible to their point of use.
Rationale: Minimizes check-to-use gaps (POCPOU/TOCTOU risk).

**CIS-06** — Return types MUST be as simple as possible: void > bool > integer > optional > error union.
Rationale: Each dimension in the return type creates viral call-site branching.

**CIS-07** — Functions with precondition assertions MUST run to completion without suspension.
Rationale: Suspension can invalidate preconditions, making assertions misleading.

**CIS-08** — Unused buffer space MUST be explicitly zeroed before use or transmission.
Rationale: Buffer underflow leaks sensitive data (Heartbleed class).

**CIS-09** — Allocation and deallocation MUST be visually grouped with surrounding blank lines.
Rationale: Makes resource leaks easy to spot during code review.

---

## Off-by-One & Arithmetic (OBO)

**OBO-01** — Index, count, and size MUST be treated as distinct types with explicit conversions.
Rationale: Casual interchange is the primary source of off-by-one errors.

**OBO-02** **(Zig)** — All integer division MUST use explicit semantics: @divExact, @divFloor, @divCeil.
Rationale: Default division may be ambiguous; explicit shows intent.

---

## Formatting & Code Style (FMT)

**FMT-01** — All code MUST be formatted by `zig fmt`.
Rationale: Eliminates style debates and ensures consistency.

**FMT-02** — Indentation MUST be 4 spaces.
Rationale: 4 spaces is Zig's standard indentation depth.

**FMT-03** — No line SHALL exceed 100 columns.
Rationale: Ensures side-by-side review with no horizontal scroll.

**FMT-04** — If statements MUST have braces unless the entire statement fits on a single line.
Rationale: Prevents "goto fail" class bugs.

---

## Dependencies & Tooling (DEP)

**DEP-01** — External dependencies MUST be minimized and justified.
Rationale: Supply chain risk, safety risk, performance risk, installation complexity.

**DEP-02** — New tools MUST NOT be introduced when an existing tool suffices.
Rationale: Tool sprawl increases complexity and maintenance burden.

**DEP-03** **(Zig)** — Scripts MUST be written in Zig. Shell scripts only for trivial glue (<20 lines).
Rationale: Zig scripts are portable, type-safe, and consistent with the toolchain.
