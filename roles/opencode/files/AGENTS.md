# OpenCode Guides — Default

This file is a selector for the local guide bundle.

You can and should edit the repo-local `.opencode/AGENTS.md` to add guides from `VARIANTS.md`.
For example, if a repo is Go-heavy, add the Go TigerStyle guide from `go/` in the Active Guides
list.

## Active Guides

- `tigerstyle-strict-full.md`
